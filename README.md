# Dissertation-code

Mostly code from my initial first draft submission to show my ideas to the academic committee so that they would allow me to work on my own project

for the comment data: https://www.kaggle.com/nickreinerink/reddit-rcryptocurrency

for the financial data: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory


Key differences between what I am presenting and what I will be doing:

Dataset expansion: I decided to collect my own data, so far I have 2013/02- 2021/06 reddit comments (~14GB) from r/cryptocurrency â€“ original I had only 5 months from 2017/11-2018/03 (0.5GB)

Financial data: presenting daily financial data from bitcoin, will likely move to work on minute resolution of data.


I will also split this notebook into files with the functions that i can call & a cleaner notebook which displays results
